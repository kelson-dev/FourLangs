# Installation

Get the latest installer from the official downloads page - currently: https://www.python.org/downloads/

As of writing this guide, that's the big yellow 'Download Python 3.11.2' button.

# Try it out
After installation, open a **new** [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_line) and type the command `py`. You should be greated with something like this:
```
Python 3.11.2 (tags/v3.11.2:878ead1, Feb  7 2023, 16:38:35) [MSC v.1934 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

To exit the `py` program type `exit()` and press `enter`.

Then switch your [working directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory) to the `FourLangs/Python/001_Hello` directory included with these lessons and run `py Program.py`. The result should be something like this:
```
Hello, Python!
```

You are now able to run the sample Python programs!

# Trouble shooting

If after succesfully running the installer you enter the command `py` and get a message something like `'py' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.` then try the following steps:
 1. Close and re-open the program you ran the command from
 2. If the problem persists, restart your computer
 3. If the problem persists, manually check that the installed python executable was added to your [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)) and then start the trouble shooting steps again at 1.

If it still isn't working or you don't know how to do step 3 then at this point you will need to seek out specific help from someone you trust.
