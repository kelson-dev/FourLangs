The first program that new coders learn is usually a program called ["Hello, World!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program). The only thing it does is output the text "Hello, World!". In most languages this is a very simple thing to do.

The sample programs do not open and graphics windows, instead they are "Console programs." They are ran from your [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) and write their output as text on your terminals screen. 

To use the command line you will need to learn how open the one that comes with your [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) (probably Windows, macOs, or Linux), navigate around your computers folders to change the [working directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_directory), and run a command.
